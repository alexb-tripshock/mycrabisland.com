<h4>The Best & Safest Way to Reach the Destin Sandbar</h4>
								<p>If you're wondering how to get to Crab Island during your vacation, it's not as hard as it looks! The best way to get to Crab Island is by <a href="crab-island-boat-rentals-and-tours.html" title="crab island boat rentals">renting a boat</a>. There is no safe way of getting to Crab Island by foot as the currents are much too strong to swim over. Options for getting to Crab Island is by kayak, paddleboard, jet ski or craigcat. Most of the watercraft rentals take place out of the Destin Harbor. There are also other watersport locations from Calhoun Avenue that run parellel to the island. </p>

<p>It depends a lot on how many people you have in your party or how long you want to stay. For those looking to stay for the entire day, a pontoon boat (AKA party barge) are recommended. If you're looking to just cruise through the island with a friend, a kayak or <a href="https://www.tripshock.com/attractions/Destin/Jet-Ski-Waverunner-Rentals/">waverunner</a> are great options.</p>

<h4>1. Is Crab Island Open all the Time?</h4>
<p>Crab Island is not a business or state park so it is technically open all the time. However, only during the day is it worth going to since most people leave after dark.</p>

<a name="2" title="find a spot at crab island"></a><br /><br />
<h4>2. Is it Hard to Find a Spot for your Boat?</h4>
<p>During the Summer season, it can be difficult to find a spot if you come late in the day - we recommend getting their early (8-9am). If you are new to boating, we recommend anchoring the boat on the outskirts of the island to prevent accidents. If the currents are strong and the wind is blowing, it can be almost impossible to nestle the boat in the middle of the island without having issues.</p>
